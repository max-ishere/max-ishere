# About me

I'm a passionate developer that makes random projects in my free time. I recently learned Rust from
"The book" and now it's my favorite language ever. I also have some experience with C++, Python and
Go, however I mostly use Rust nowadays.

Looking back on some of my older projects, they have so many beginner mistakes and its nice to see
progress, even as meaningless as learning how to sign my commits and properly use user.name and
user.email for GitHub.

[My GPG signing key](https://github.com/max-ishere/max-ishere/blob/main/max-ishere-public-key.asc)
that I use for GitHub-related activities.
