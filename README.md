# GPG signed releases commits

I am migrating to using signed commits and uploading signed checksum files for most projects. This
is not a promise that all projects will have signed commits, but I will try to do so. To verify that
a commit has been signed by me you can import the following key:

[My GPG signing key](https://github.com/max-ishere/max-ishere/blob/main/max-ishere-public-key.asc)

This key should only be considered valid in the context of GitHub signed commits, Signed releases and
as proof of owvership of this account. It certainly should be invalid outside of GitHub and software
development scopes. I will try to stick to this policy to reduce the impact in case the key is revoked
or leaked.
